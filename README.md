# Porsche Showcase iOS App

This Porsche app was built using **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, and **SceneKit** to display Porsche car models with interactive 3D features. It follows the **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, promoting a clean separation of concerns for better maintainability. The app delivers detailed car information and enhances the user experience with pan gestures and authentic engine sound effects.
